            You know what we love here at True Bloods? The Swannies. <br /><br />
            You know what we hate? How the mainstream media just doesn't give us the love we deserve. <br /><br />
            Here at True Bloods, we talk everything Sydney Swans.
            From exclusive interviews with Bloods legends to deep dives on the seasons games,
            we give you the Swannies fix the mainstream media just cannot provide. <br /><br />
            We love our social engagement. Send in your voice notes or message us on your socials
            to have the chance to be featured on the poddy. <br /><br />
            Come have some 'results-based piss' with us and get to know the incredible community
            of Bloods supporters either before or after the Swannies game
            (location announced on the poddy).<br /><br />
            Tune into the pod each week from Wednesday 6am wherever you get your podcasts. Up the bloods and up the poddy!
